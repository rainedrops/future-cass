This board game features a 1 v 3 asymetric experience, where the attack team composed of three hackers is tasked to infiltrate a building to retrieve some sensitive data.
The last player enroles the building's defense system, whose task is to stop the burglars, by any means necessary.
As the game jam's theme was "all according to plan...?"
We designed a turn based action system where attacking players setup a sequence of moves and actions by laying cards in a column.
The defense then has the opportunity to sabotage their sequence by playing trap cards to influence or negate their actions.
The board is stuffed with terminals players can interact with to recieve new cards and enhancements, and traps they must avoid if they hope to get out in one piece.

We have gotten a lot of positive reviews during open playtesting with the other teams, so now we are looking forward to finalize and produce this game !
